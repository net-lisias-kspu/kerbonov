# kerbonov-parts-pack :: Change Log

* 2018-1116: 2.0.0 (LinuxGuruGamer) for KSP 1.5.1
	+ No changelog provided
* 2016-1225: 12 (Sam_Hall) for KSP 1.2.0
	+ UPDATE 12/2016
	+ Many changes this time:
		- Updated compatibility for KSP 1.2.x
		- Grid fin: Folds now; requires the installation of linuxgurugamer's RetractableLiftingSurface Module ( <http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/145583-12-retractableliftingsurface-module-released/> ) for proper functioning. Not having this additional mod won't outright break your saves or anything but the grid fins won't work quite right.
		- Edited properties of some other parts for better balance in newer versions of KSP. The mini turbojet, for example, lost its original useful niche after the introduction of the "Juno" engine, so it's been shrunk down even further to basically RC model aircraft scale.
		- Too many graphics updates to list individually. Edited or completely remade nearly all models and textures on most parts. Most diffuse, normal and emissive textures have been tweaked extensively to minimize S3 compression artifacting. The KN2 and passenger pod now share their stock-alike aesthetic with the modern 24-sided airplane parts, instead of the old 18-sided C7 ones.
		- Added several new parts: KN-7 spaceplane cockpit module (with IVA), 2 new cargo bays, 2 new LFO tanks, 2 new sizes of LF drop tank, 1 new antenna, a second grid fin, and a 45-degree angled version of the probe RCS block.
	+ Installation:
	+ No special installation instructions for a fresh install; just drag-and-drop
	+ the contents of the GameData folder as usual.
	+ Also install RetractableLiftingSurface Module from the link above if you want
	+ the grid fins to function correctly when folding and unfolding.
	+ If you're upgrading from a previous version of this parts pack then be aware
	+ some file or folder names have changed, so delete any previous version of the
	+ Kerbonov folder you've got installed or bad and weird stuff is very likely to
	+ happen.
	+ IMPORTANT NOTE:
	+ Several of the new parts use textures from the Squad GameData folder in order
	+ to save memory and keep things looking as stock-alike as possible. If the
	+ T1600 or X200-4 fuel tanks or the CRG-05 or -09 cargo bays show up with blank
	+ or garbled textures, it's probably because you're using some stock model
	+ replacer that alters or deletes those texture files.
	+ UPDATE 5/2015:
	+ fixed compatability with 1.0. Converted textures to .dds format.
	+ UPDATE 7/2014:
	+ 0.24 time; Adjusted prices to bring everything more in line with the stock
	+ parts.
	+ UPDATE 5/2014:
	+ Added three extra parts to pack, touched up some textures on KN2 internals,
	+ fixed nonworking sound effects on micro radial decoupler and RATO motor
